# Little Monsters

This is the final project for Software Carpentry. This is a tile-matching puzzle video game like Bejeweled and Candycrush, but instead of jewels we have cute monsters.  

## Description 

Swap two adjacent gems left or right to try to match three gems in a row. The matched gems then disappear, making way for new gems to fall from the top. Matching more than three gems, or causing a chain reaction of gem matches will result in more points. The playerâ€™s score slowly drops over time, so the player must constantly be making new matches. The game ends when no possible match can be made on the board.

## Rules

1) For basic score, 1 point for 1 disappeared gem
2) For bonus score, 4 gems in line equal 5 points, while 5 gems in line equal 10.
3) The game time goes back to 0 everytime you make a match. 
4) Game time increases by 1 second per second.
5) Game is over when the user quits.
